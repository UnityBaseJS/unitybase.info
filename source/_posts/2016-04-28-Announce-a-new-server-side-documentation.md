During last two week we are working on the new version on server-side documentation.
Previous version are generated using [jsduck](https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck) - the API documentation generator for Sencha JavaScript frameworks.

There is a two reason to migrate away from `jsduck`:
 - documentation generated by jsduck are not SEO friendly
 - it not mobile-friendly also
 - we can't easy control a generation process
 - and it is HUGE size

Since we are not use ExtJS on the server-side anymore we decide to found a alternative.

As a generator we decide to use a [jsdoc](http://usejsdoc.org/).

But none of the existing themas did not work for us, so we create our own - [ub-jsdoc](https://github.com/UnityBaseJS/ub-jsdoc).

Also we patch a little a `jsdoc` sources, because our primary JavaScript IDE do not understand a jsdoc module syntax `{module:moduleName~ClassName}`.
Because of this so we add ability to jsdoc to search a class definition inside any module. So now if jsdoc found `@type {MyClass}` comment
and `MyClass` is not defined globally, it will search for `MyClass` inside all available modules.

The next step is to add a Full Text Search for our template - we do it ASAP using [lunr](http://lunrjs.com/)

The new Server-side API is [here](/api/serverNew/)
